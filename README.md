### URL & Additional Information

The website is deployed at [jgraven.com](https://jgraven.com); it is hosted by Namecheap[^2]. Icons and images were sourced with a few third-party resources.[^3] Additional attributions are made in some source files.

[^1]: So far the site has truly only been tested on Chrome. A small amount of testing has been done on Firefox and Safari as well. There shouldn't be too many concerns involving untested browsers, however, because the site (code) is pretty light.

[^2]: [Namecheap](https://www.namecheap.com/) is a domain name registrar and web hosting company.

[^3]: Icons used in the site footer were downloaded from [iconify.design](https://www.iconify.design) and favicons were created at [favicon.ico](https://www.favicon.io). Images were downloaded from [Canva](https://www.canva.com/).
