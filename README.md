# Portfolio Site Repo | Jacob Graven

## To see the live website, visit [jgraven.com](https://jgraven.com). 

Note: because of poor planning early on, the site is not fully responsive and it does not adapt well to mobile devices. I plan on redesigning the current content so that it focuses on mobile layouts first.
