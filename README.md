### URL & Additional Information

The website is deployed at [jgraven.com](https://jgraven.com); it is hosted by Namecheap[^2]. Icons and images were sourced with a few third-party resources.[^3] Additional attributions are made in some source files.

[^1]: The site has truly only been tested on Chrome (so far). Some testing has been done on Firefox and Safari, but not much. However, there shouldn't be too many concerns involving untested browsers because the code is pretty lightweight.

[^2]: [Namecheap](https://www.namecheap.com/) is a domain name registrar and web hosting company.

[^3]: Icons used in the site footer were downloaded from [iconify.design](https://www.iconify.design) and favicons were created at [favicon.ico](https://www.favicon.io). Images were downloaded from [Canva](https://www.canva.com/).
